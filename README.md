# 🌐 Rakhine – Myanmar Parallel Corpus

This repository contains a parallel dataset for **Rakhine ↔ Myanmar machine translation** and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research.

## 🎯 Purpose

This dataset is designed for:

* Machine Translation (MT)
* Language Modeling
* NLP Research
* Dialect Analysis (Rakhine and Standard Burmese)
* Language Preservation

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The Rakhine language is a major language variety spoken in Rakhine State, Myanmar. However, digital language resources for Rakhine remain limited.

This project aims to build:

* 📚 A parallel sentence corpus (Rakhine ↔ Myanmar)
* 🧠 Training data for AI translation models
* 🔊 Future speech and text datasets
* 🌍 Open resources for Rakhine language technology

# 📊 Data Format

## CSV Format (Parallel Sentences)

| rakhine       | myanmar       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ငါ စားပြီးဗျာယ် | ငါ စားပြီးပြီ |
| နင် ဇာမှာလဲ      | သင် ဘယ်မှာလဲ  |

# ⚙️ How to Build the Dataset

## 1. Prepare Raw Text Files

Place the following files in the `raw_data/` directory:

* `raw_data/rakhine_text.txt`
* `raw_data/myanmar_text.txt`

## 2. Run the Alignment Script

```bash
python scripts/align_sentences.py
```

## 3. Generated Output

```text
data/train.csv
```

# 🧠 Use Cases

* Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
* Chatbot Training
* Rakhine–Myanmar Language Research
* Dialect Comparison
* Language Preservation
* NLP Benchmark Development

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add an English translation layer (Rakhine ↔ Myanmar ↔ English)
* Add speech datasets (audio + transcription)
* Improve alignment using semantic similarity models
* Expand the dataset to 10,000+ sentence pairs
* Publish on Hugging Face Datasets
* Create benchmark evaluation datasets

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

* The initial dataset uses rule-based sentence alignment (line-by-line).
* Translation quality depends on manual curation.
* Semantic alignment methods are recommended for large-scale datasets.
* The dataset is currently limited in size and coverage.
